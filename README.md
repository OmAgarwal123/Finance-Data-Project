# Finance-Data-Project

This Finance Data Analysis Project explores financial datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and insights using Python. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), time series forecasting, and investment strategy evaluation through statistical and machine learning techniques. The dataset includes key financial metrics like stock prices, volume, and moving averages, sourced from platforms such as Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage. The project leverages Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-learn for analysis and visualization. Additionally, predictive models like ARIMA and LSTMs are applied to forecast financial trends. Future enhancements include real-time data integration, advanced portfolio optimization, and sentiment analysis using financial news.
